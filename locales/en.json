We reject the false notion of scarcity that has led people and nations alike to hoard their work. Sharing information helps us all grow.</p><p>This website embodies these ideals through its open-source codebase (accessible by clicking the github button in the top right), a live chat for free discussion and debate, a forum for proposing new ideas, and a file host for sharing results. Each of these components combine to form a hub where passionate individuals can combine their skills and work 'for the benefit of all'.</p>"
